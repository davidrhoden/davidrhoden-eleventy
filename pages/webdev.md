I'm primarily a front-end developer with expertise in visually implementing web designs, but I also have back-end experience on all kinds of websites. My main back-end language is PHP, but I have also worked in Ruby on Rails (and a tiny bit in Django/Python) and have a lot of experience working on sites built with the .net framework.

On the front end, I have extensive experience with CSS/Sass, Javascript and jQuery, and other useful libraries like Lodash, Underscore, and Masonry. I've worked with several popular content management systems, notably CraftCMS, Wordpress, and Expression Engine, and I've created custom content management for clients as well.
