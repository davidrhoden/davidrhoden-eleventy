David Rhoden is a painter, animator, and illustrator, currently based in New Orleans. And I'm David Rhoden.

I am also a musician, currently playing guitar with The Stacks; previously, I was a member of Mountain Shoutin', Jimmy and the Wolfpack, All-Night Movers, The Sleepy Heads, MAXIMVS!, Dirty Knives, The Hi-Balls, Snake Oil, Everything Tool, The Innuendos, Dark Marbles, Cheerio and the Camels, and The Red M&Ms.

I have had more jobs than you can count, including being an ice cream man and an oyster shucker for one day each. I started my post-collegiate work career as a freelance writer and an assistant editor at Golden Books, spent some years toiling in various departments at Citibank and Goldman Sachs, then, through a series of temp jobs, found my way into the business of design and marketing, where I work as a web developer and designer.
