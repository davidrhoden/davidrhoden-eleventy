# David Rhoden: Illustration

My illustration work has two major styles. When I first started doing illustration work for clients, I worked in watercolor over pencil. I love the way it looks, but I stopped doing it because you can't make any corrections at all. If the client wants a change, or if the illustrator wants a change, you have to start over. It's a deadline thing.

More recently, I've been working in a more digital style. I still like the way it looks, but it's a lot easier to change and improve things.

I did these "bio boards" for a company that did conferences for advertising executives. To make it easier for conference goers to connect the speakers to their industry or company, we made these bio boards to help make the connection.
