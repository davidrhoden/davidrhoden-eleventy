# David Rhoden: Web Development

I'm primarily a front-end developer with expertise in visually implementing web designs, but I also have back-end experience on all kinds of websites. My main back-end language is PHP, but I have also worked in Ruby on Rails (and a tiny bit in Django/Python) and have a lot of experience working on sites built with the .net framework.

On the front end, I have extensive experience with CSS/Sass, Javascript and jQuery, and other useful libraries like Lodash, Underscore, and Masonry. I've worked with several popular content management systems, notably CraftCMS, Wordpress, and Expression Engine, and I've created custom content management for clients as well.

## [Luke Spurr Allen](https://davidrhoden.com/web/luke-spurr-allen)

A Craft CMS site for a New Orleans-based singer-songwriter and his band. A fun feature of this site: it automagically creates a poster for every upcoming show, complete with random paper colors.

## [Gina Phillips: Crow Valley](https://davidrhoden.com/web/gina-phillips-crow-valley)

## [Mike Edison](https://davidrhoden.com/web/mike-edison)

Mike just came out with a great memoir (his second!) called*[You Are A Complete Disappointment](http://amzn.to/2nWqALe)*, it is so good and so funny and very real. Please, click the[link](http://amzn.to/2nWqALe)to learn more.

His other books are good too.[Go to the site](http://mikeedison.com/)to find out more.

I did all the design and development on this site. The site is built with Craft CMS.

## [This Is My Happening](https://davidrhoden.com/web/this-is-my-happening)

A CraftCMS website to display an artist's works for sale. (In this case the artist is me.)

## [Bajibot website](https://davidrhoden.com/web/bajibot-website)

Nearly everything on the page is animated in some way. Really, it's too much. The site uses AJAX to load the case studies. I had to build custom scrollers for the case studies that were longer than the space allotted. Also, the video reel was done as HTML5 video with custom controls and a Flash fallback. It's all built on top of Wordpress, believe it or not.

## [Hurray For The Riff Raff](https://davidrhoden.com/web/hurray-for-the-riff-raff)

I did all the design and coding for this responsive website for a major-label recording artist.

It's a custom theme built on top of a Wordpress back end.

## [DBSTL timesheet shamer](https://davidrhoden.com/web/dbstl-timesheet-shamer)

I was the sole developer on this site for an Austin-based advertising agency.

We were looking for a way to urge employees to get timesheets in more promptly without taking a Big-Brotherish approach. We decided on gentle public shaming.

## [AT&T: The Innovators](https://davidrhoden.com/web/at-t-the-innovators)

When I asked how the hover should be implemented on mobile devices, I discovered there was no plan for mobile. The designer and art director assumed the site would be done in Flash.

## [Eatucator](https://davidrhoden.com/web/eatucator)

I did the front-end development for this funny-named New York City-based startup providing couponing services for independent grocers and producers.

## [American Express Travel](https://davidrhoden.com/web/american-express-travel)

As a front-end developer with iSeatz, I worked closely with the New York City design firm whose design we were implementing on the American Express travel site. I also worked to make our front-end code consistent across hotel, car and air purchases.

## [Crown Royal](https://davidrhoden.com/web/crown-royal)

I also worked for about a year at an all-digital New York City advertising agency called MRM Worldwide (now MRM//McCann). I worked on sites for Crown Royal, Smirnoff, and the U.S. Army.

I did lots of CSS and jQuery on this unique interface.

## [Red Bull Manny Mania](https://davidrhoden.com/web/red-bull-manny-mania)

A "manny" is some kind of skatingboard trick you can do without a ramp or something. This was a site that let you vote on who did the best ones. I did the coding and connected up the database to count the votes. There was some IP tracking to sorta stop people from stuffing the box. There was a lot of video on this site too.

## [The Frisky](https://davidrhoden.com/web/the-frisky)

I spent about a year working for The Frisky, which was a Turner Broadcasting property at the time.

The site was aimed at 18-39 year old women. Every once in a while they would do a story that required a photograph of a generic male, for which I was sometimes pressed into action, so, technically, I am a male model.

## [Subway Now](https://davidrhoden.com/web/subway-now)

I was one of two front-end developers on this early entry in the fast food pre-order game, working for a company called GoMobo (now named Olo), competing mostly with Seamless Web. I applied "skins" to our white-label ordering site, and set up Photoshop files to create new skins quickly for prospective clients.

## [Amber Sexton Photography](https://davidrhoden.com/web/amber-sexton-photography)

A custom weblog based on Expression Engine and a custom CMS for photos for this Brooklyn-based photographer. The site employs David DeSandro's popular Masonry plug-in for the home page's responsive photo display.
