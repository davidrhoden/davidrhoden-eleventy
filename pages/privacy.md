# David Rhoden: Privacy Policy

The only way I collect personal information on this site is if you sign up for my MailChimp mailing list. On there I ask for your name and e-mail, and sometimes your mailing address, if I'm sending you mail. That's it.

If you sign up for email from me I do not and will not sell, give away, or share that information. You can always unsubscribe from my MailChimp list.
